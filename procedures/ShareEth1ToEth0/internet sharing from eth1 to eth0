Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file to enable packet forwarding

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Remove the # from the beginning of the line containing  net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 This will enable packet forwarding on next reboot. But if you want to try it right now without reboot then do this.

sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
We also need to share RPi’s internet connection with the devices connected over Wi-Fi. We will configure a NAT between eth0 and  wlan0:

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE  
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT  
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT  
However, we need these rules to be applied every time we reboot the Pi, so run  sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat" to save the rules to the file /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat. Now we need to run this after each reboot, so open the /etc/rc.local file with  sudo nano /etc/rc.local and just above the line exit 0, add the following line:

iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat  
And that’s all! Now just Reboot your RPi and you will be able to access Internet

sudo reboot
